# Best matched restaurants

## Introduction
This is an exercise to find the best-matched restaurants given a set of search criterias as filter input.

## Find the best-matched restaurants
You have data about local restaurants located near your company, which you can find in the **./resources/data/restaurants.csv** file. You would like to develop a basic search function that allows your colleagues to search those restaurants to help them find where they would like to have lunch. The search is based on five criteria: **Restaurant Name, Customer Rating(1 star ~ 5 stars), Distance(1 mile ~ 10 miles), Price(how much one person will spend on average, $10 ~ $50), Cuisine(Chinese, American, Thai, etc.).** The requirements are listed below.

1. The function should allow users to provide up to five parameters based on the criteria listed above. *You can assume each parameter can contain only one value.*
2. If parameter values are invalid, return an error message.
3. The function should return up to five matches based on the provided criteria. If no matches are found, return an empty list. If less than 5 matches are found, return them all. If more than 5 matches are found, return the best 5 matches. The returned results should be sorted according to the rules explained below. Every record in the search results should at least contain the restaurant name.
4. “Best match” is defined as below:
   - A Restaurant Name match is defined as an exact or partial String match with what users provided. For example, “Mcd” would match “Mcdonald’s”.
   - A Customer Rating match is defined as a Customer Rating equal to or more than what users have asked for. For example, “3” would match all the 3 stars restaurants plus all the 4 stars and 5 stars restaurants.
   - A Distance match is defined as a Distance equal to or less than what users have asked for. For example, “2” would match any distance that is equal to or less than 2 miles from your company.
   - A Price match is defined as a Price equal to or less than what users have asked for. For example, “15” would match any price that is equal to or less than $15 per person.
   - A Cuisine match is defined as an exact or partial String match with what users provided. For example, “Chi” would match “Chinese”. You can find all the possible Cuisines in the **./resources/data/cuisines.csv** file. *You can assume each restaurant offers only one cuisine.*
   - The five parameters are holding an “AND” relationship. For example, if users provide Name = “Mcdonald’s” and Distance = 2, you should find all “Mcdonald’s” within 2 miles.
   - When multiple matches are found, you should sort them as described below.
     - Sort the restaurants by Distance first.
     - After the above process, if two matches are still equal, then the restaurant with a higher customer rating wins.
     - After the above process, if two matches are still equal, then the restaurant with a lower price wins.
     - After the above process, if two matches are still equal, then you can randomly decide the order.
     - Example: if the input is Customer Rating = 3 and Price = 15. Mcdonald’s is 4 stars with an average spend = $10, and it is 1 mile away. And KFC is 3 stars with an average spend = $8, and it is 1 mile away. Then we should consider Mcdonald’s as a better match than KFC. (They both matches the search criteria -> we compare distance -> we get a tie -> we then compare customer rating -> Mcdonald’s wins)
5. The final submitted work should include a README file. No UI is required in this assessment, but you may implement one if you would like. **The steps to run and test your program should be clearly introduced in the README file.** If you have made any additional **Assumptions** besides what we have listed above while working on this assessment, please document them so that we can better understand your solution.

## Technology Stack

This porject uses the following technology stack:
- JDK 11
- Quarkus 2.7.2
- Maven
- Docker
- JUnit5

## Running the Application Container
To jump start the application and try it out, build the Docker image and run the container as below.

On the project root folder, build the image with (grab your coffee ☕, it may take some minutes to download all the dependencies and compile it):
```shell script
docker build -t quarkus/find-best-restaurant .
```
Then run the container using:
```shell script
docker run -i --rm -p 8080:8080 quarkus/find-best-restaurant
```

## Frontend Development
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.


## Backend Development
### Install dependencies

Install maven dependencies first:
```shell script
./mvnw install
```

### Running the application in dev mode

You can run your application in dev mode that enables live coding using:
```shell script
./mvnw compile quarkus:dev
```

### Running test suite

You can run the test suite using:
```shell script
./mvnw test
```

### Packaging and running the application

The application can be packaged using:
```shell script
./mvnw package
```
